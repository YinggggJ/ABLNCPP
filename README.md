# ABLNCPP

A Non-coding RNA Coding Potential Prediction Model Based on BiLSTM and Attention Mechanism

## Requirements

python == 3.7 <br>

pandas == 1.3.5 <br>

torch == 1.7.1 <br>

scipy == 1.5.4 <br>

scikit-learn == 1.0.2

## Dataset

The dataset of ABLNCPP is displayed in the data folder. 

high-confidence.fa includes the transcripts in the high-confident subset of LNCipedia 5. SPENCER.fa and LNCipedia5.fa are positive and negative samples of ABLNCPP, respectively.

## Usage

1. Data Preprocessing

    preprocessing.py    - Preprocessing transcript information from fasta file (.fa or .fasta) and calculating corresponding features.
    
    Example:
    
    ```
    $ python preprocessing.py --withcp data/SPENCER.fa --withoutcp data/LNCipedia5.fa
    ```
    
2. After data preprocessing, sequence embeddings are generated by `NOLTE.py`.

3. Then, run `ABLNCPP.py` to train and evaluate the model.

4. Run `predict.py` to predict coding type and coding potential of the ncRNA transcript. 

The other details can be seen in the paper and the codes.

## Features

The features SNR and Peak are calculated by [LncFinder](https://github.com/HAN-Siyu/LncFinder).
